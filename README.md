* This is my vim configuration file. I will maintain this all the time.

## How to Use this.
{
***I add this at 2016-10-31. I will find a easier way to use it.

** Don't start vim before you read below.
** Believe it's good for you.

** Git clone my_rep to your defalut user path. Then you need to create a folder name .vim and come in.
** Then you need vundle. You can find vundle at (https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). git clone to this directory.
** You should ensure the directory is like this [~/.vim/bundle/vundle/]. The folder vundle is you git clone just now.
** when you finish all of above. You can start vim. At first time when you start it, it appears many errors. Just ignore that.
** Then type this command.
** <Esc>
** :BundleInstall

** it costs some time. Just wait.
